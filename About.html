                    Hi friend , I am Saurabh Mukherjee and this is about me.I am from Kashipur , a small village in the district of Purulia in the state of West Bengal.
I originally belong to Purulia but I have spent most of my life in Bokaro , a town nearby to my village .I live with my parents in Bokaro and I completed my 
schooling from Crescent Public School ,Chas ,Bokaro .Then I chose to pursue Engineering .I have always been fascinated by the way computers work and amazed
by the idea that a thing created by humans can beat humans in almost all of the tasks.This thing brought in me a deep interest to pursue Computer Science and
Engineering .I am very glad to get the opportunity to study Computer Science and Engineering from one of the most prestigious institutions of India -Jadavpur
University.The culture of JU is great and the interaction of professor and student can't be seen anywhere in this world other than JU.I believe in the philos
ophy of taking tradition with technology such that we keep growing and becoming more sound with the everyday advancement in technology but at the same time 
we do not forget the traditions , the culture of our country and the moral values which are a must in the long run of life .Thanks again for your precious time 
.
