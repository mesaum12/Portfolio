                        Sometimes I feel that life is so much busy nowadays that even sitting idle can be 
                        considered as one of the most difficult task as we are always imagining that there 
                        is someone at this moment who is an inch ahead of us towards the
                         finishing line . But should we consider life as some race ? I don't think so 
                         because life is there with us to learn and we are all the characters playing 
                         out part as Shakespeare said. Success and Failure , love and hatred , happiness
                          and grief are relative terms as the condition of grief for someone is yet a dream 
                          for others as they are not even able to think of what grief is . Possibly the reason
                           for this rat race in this modern world is a sudden understanding of inferiority and
                            the sense that " I have nothing as compared to ...." . Do these really matter or
                             effect to who we are . We always tend to be like other person who is likeable and
                              being loved by everyone but shall we lose our own character just because it's the 
                              time for others to play their part .. One shall possess the uniqueness he has by 
                              birth till death and that must not be affected by other's perception of who we are
                               or what is perfect for us to do . We should be happy of who we are , as scientifically
                                the process of thinking of no two individuals can be same as we are a permutations 
                                of the genes which are no way the same for any two of us ..

                        <br>
                        I sometimes cannot find any reasons for my failure but I wonder that it is
                         sometimes good to fail because then we try to uplift ourselves to the real 
                         situation where we can learn the things in a more nice manner .My mother 
                         always says whatever happens happens for the best , maybe it is true that
                          life is trying to build some new twist for us which is better than what 
                          we expect .Since we can always see the present before us but can see the
                           impact of our failures in the future. But let me mention this , if we keep 
                           working hard to achieve our dream and are not moved by failures , then it is 
                           for sure that we are going to achieve and see results what we haven't ever
                            imagined. But sitting idle and saying that whatever happens happens for the
                             best is just useless thing because as Shri Krishna says to Arjuna we should
                              focus on work and not about the results , we should always be working towards our goal.

                        <br>
                         Hello reader ,I am writing this blog after a lot of days and today I found that 
                         I should not be carrying the burden of thoughts that I am having right now not
                          accusing of any individual for the same rather an observation made from everyday
                           happenings , maybe a similar situation you too would face someday ,nobody can say 
                           ,though I hope that you wouldn't and that's why let me continue with the facts 
                           that I want to write down with all the experiences that I have .I know you might 
                           be busy but I hope that even in this busy schedule when you are bored of doing 
                            things which you have been doing for the last decade and not enough energy is 
                            left to pursue the things with the same zeal you started with. Sometimes life 
                            too denies the fact of you rather  me being too good as it is habituated with 
                            the fallacy of faces carrying something in mind and wearing a smile which is 
                            truly never their own. I have experienced that the slightest of your achievements
                             can make you out of the company of your mates where you used to play one of the
                              leading roles someday and even you wouldn't even know when the stream of feelings
                               of the person standing besides you changes its direction and you are still the
                                same. Life is always such unpredictable and would always be .When you give 
                                special preferences to someone for the quanta of happiness you want to share
                                 ,it becomes a kind of betrayal in that person's eyes even if you are still 
                                 thinking whether you have really done something .Sometimes someone expects 
                                 you to be a perfect person but then philosophy says that you must be imperfect to 
                                 learn something rather you would be out of purpose in this world the moment you get perfection
                                  inside your pocket .These are the plight of none other than the reader who is 
                                  reading it and maybe you misjudged somebody someday ,you must know that we all
                                   live in a society which is always dragged by the inertia of power which is
                                    however a relative term and not carrying any specific meaning in reference
                                     to this para but at the end everyone is hoping to get some pennies to live 
                                     happily in their own garret. Before judging somebody which we do every 2
                                     
                                 seconds we must wear his shoes and try to know whether he had any other
                                  option or not and because of which "sometimes you are bad being too good " .
